A great deal has been said and often times little done about the issue of testing in software and systems. I remember as far back as when Computing Weekly brought to our attention issues with the Horizon system that we have recently become very aware of in connection with Post Office. I have to wonder if testing had been more rigorous for this ill fated system, how differently things could have turned out.
