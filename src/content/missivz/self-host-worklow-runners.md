Pipelines are a great way to automate your workflow. They can be used to build, test, and deploy your code. However, they can be expensive to run on cloud services. In this missive, we will look at how easy it can be to  self-host your workflow runners that would normally run on Github. Not just build minutes and expense be saved but also we can extend workflows to reach into our own infrastructure, previously not possible in standard cloud-based CI/CD.
