# TLDR

Install an editor you like, a good one is VSCode with the markdown preview extension built in.

Write daily journals and notes in markdown, and use a static site generator to publish them to the web when you're ready. 

Markdown can be as simple as plain text, or as complex as you want it to be with headings, lists, tables, images, code blocks, and more.

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to write plain text that can be converted to HTML. It's a great way to write notes, journals, and blog posts.

You can concentrate on the content, and not worry about the formatting. This is sometimes called "WYSIWYM" (What You See Is What You Mean) but I like to call it 'distraction free writing'. Gone are the days of fiddling with fonts, margins, and spacing in Word or Google Docs. Remember WordPerfect? I do, and I don't miss it.

So you dont need to write anything other than plain text, but you can add formatting if you want to. You can add headings, images, links and more.

```
# This is a heading level 1

## This is a heading level 2

Unlock your writing flow:

Pick anything and start. Don't overthink. Just grab your laptop and go.

Stream your day. Journal about what you did, what you plan, and what pops into your head. Thoughts, feelings, ideas â€“ anything!

Make it private. Your journal is your safe space. Nobody needs to read it unless you want them to.

Crush writer's block. Forget grammar and spelling for now. Just capture your ideas and build a regular writing habit.

Set a word count (optional). Microsoft's VSCode plugin makes it easy.

Tap into AI. Ask Bard, ChatGPT, or Bing Chat questions related to your writing. Paste their answers into your journal for instant inspiration.

More is more (in drafts). Don't worry about being concise just yet. You can always cut down later.

Polish with AI. Paste your draft into Bard. It'll fix typos, tighten up the prose, and make it shine.

Review and add your magic. Read Bard's edits, and feel free to put your own spin on things.

Remember, consistency is key. So pick up your pen, embrace the messy first draft, and let the words flow!
