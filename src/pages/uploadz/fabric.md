# TL;DR

The world of AI is full of tools and libraries, but Fabric stands out for its focus on prompt engineering. Prompt engineering involves crafting clever questions for large language models (LLMs) to improve the quality and accuracy of their responses. Fabric simplifies prompt creation and management, making it easy to use prompts for various tasks, including content creation and document analysis.

The following command line using Fabric takes the transcript from a YouTube video and creates a quality summary that could be used in an article, journal, even a knowledge base or whatever takes your fancy :

```bash
	  yt --transcript https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODP6tTpjqA | fabric --stream --pattern extract_wisdom
```

# The Rise of Prompt Engineering and how Fabric Makes it Easy

There are many AI tools and libraries available, but [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler) from Daniel Miessler offers a unique approach focused on prompt engineering.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves crafting specific questions for large language models (LLMs) to enhance the quality and accuracy of their responses. Traditionally, we rely on "clever prompts" embedded with instructions or prerequisites. These prompts can improve the LLM's understanding and allow us to "augment" its knowledge with recent information not included in its training data.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Databases

RAG is an architectural approach that leverages custom data to improve LLM efficacy. RAGs often utilize vector-based databases, which function like search engines, to identify relevant information based on your query. This information is then fed into your prompt, providing the LLM with readily available and potentially curated data from the latest sources. Additionally, personal data reflecting your preferences and interests can further enrich the prompt.

# Crafting Powerful Prompts with Fabric

Fabric simplifies the creation and management of prompts, making it easier for anyone to leverage prompt engineering. You can create your own prompts or use pre-built ones for various tasks, saving you significant time and effort compared to manual methods.

# Fabric's Appeal for Developers

Fabric's command-line interface utilizes a familiar Unix-style "piped" input/output system, a well-established and efficient method of human-computer interaction. Developers, particularly those with DevOps, SysOps, system administration, or full-stack development experience, will find Fabric's interface intuitive and user-friendly.

# Initial Exploration with Fabric

While vector database integration with Fabric is not something I have found yet, I've already begun exploring its existing capabilities. With minimal effort, I've successfully used Fabric for content creation and technical document analysis, including analyzing YouTube transcripts without needing to watch the videos. Fabric's ease of use has allowed me to become proficient quickly

# Getting Started with Fabric

I'm using Linux, Ubuntu 22.04 running in WSL which will work similarly on other Linux distributions but you would need to modify syntax to suit for your package manager of choice. [Instructions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-the-fabric-commands) for Mac use `brew`.

I ran `which pipx` to see if I had it installed on my system

```bash
fabric on ÓÇ† main is üì¶ v1.2.0 via üêç v3.10.12
‚ùØ which pipx

fabric on ÓÇ† main is üì¶ v1.2.0 via üêç v3.10.12
```

So I did not have `pipx` installed on this system, being a newly setup WSL on windows but this is to be expected as I have not used it before and it is one of the several methods out there for configuring python virtual environments that I have not used much up to now - see  [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) site for more info on it.

I'll update / upgrade all packages to get started
```bash
‚ùØ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

now to install `pipx` :

```bash
‚ùØ sudo apt install pipx -y
```

and check it is installed :

```bash
‚ùØ pipx --version
1.0.0
```

which looks ok and without `--version` flag I get loads of help, which is good so, I should be able to install `fabric` if the docs are up to date at the time of me doing this first, I clone `fabric` with

```bash
https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric.git
```

and cd into the cloned git repository with `cd fabric` so that I can next install fabric with

```bash
‚ùØ pipx install .
installed package fabric 1.2.0, installed using Python 3.10.12
These apps are now globally available
	- fabric
	- fabric-api
	- fabric-webui
	- save
	- ts
	- yt
‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: '/home/jon/.local/bin' is not on your PATH environment variable. These apps will not be globally accessible until your
	PATH is updated. Run `pipx ensurepath` to automatically add it, or manually modify your PATH in your shell's config file (i.e.
	~/.bashrc).
done! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```

I subsequently added the line `export PATH=/home/jon/.local/bin:$PATH` to my `~/.bashrc` file and then ran `source ~/.bashrc` to activate this in my current shell. I was able to see `fabric` in my path

```bash
‚ùØ which fabric
/home/jon/.local/bin/fabric
```

which allowed me to run its setup

```bash
fabric --setup
```

This asks for a number of keys for openai, youtube which you may enter, I guess you will need at least one to make any kind of sense of this unless running local LLMs which I am not currently on this aged pavillion laptop but I will revisit the exercise on something more capable at a later date. I also chose to `sudo apt install ffmpeg` as when I ran `fabric` it looked for this and found it missing, again, likely the case as this is a newly setup linux and I have not had a requirement to add this up to now

I can now run `fabric`

```bash
fabric on ÓÇ† main is üì¶ v1.2.0 via üêç v3.10.12 took 47s
‚ùØ fabric

```

and get literally nothing back, no errors, nada as is common with something command line that is awaiting piped input.

The main thing is that there are no errors so I am a happy camper. Now, I'd like to take it for a run with a youtube video

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ODP6tTpjqA" title="Progressive Web Apps in 2024" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[by awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODP6tTpjqA) talking about PWAs and if they are still relevant, spoiler alert it appears that they are, despite the nay sayers

this is how `yt` a part of `fabric` can be used in a command line pipe to get a summary without having to watch the video :

```bash
yt --transcript https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODP6tTpjqA | fabric --stream --pattern extract_wisdom

# Writing your own prompts

Creating your own [custom patters](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-patterns) is straightforward. The patterns that come with `fabric` are installed locally to `~/.config/fabric/patterns` so you can add your own here, each of which are held in their own directory and called at the command line by the folder name.

Reading through the patterns, or prompts that come with `fabric` shows how existing prompts are used to create essays, write newsletters, generate tweets and more. As prompts are written in markdown they are easy to read for us as humans and work for AIs such as OpenAI. 

For example, copying the `extract_wisdom` directory to your own say `my_extract_wisdom` and then editing `system.md` in your new folder to suit your use case is used as above with 

```bash
yt --transcript https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODP6tTpjqA | fabric --stream --pattern my_extract_wisdom
```

# Conclusion

Fabric offers a compelling solution for those seeking to leverage the power of prompt engineering. Its user-friendly interface and pre-built prompts make it accessible for anyone, while its command-line structure caters specifically to developers. By simplifying prompt creation and management, Fabric empowers users to unlock the potential of large language models for various tasks, including content creation, document analysis, and information extraction from multimedia sources like YouTube videos. As the field of AI continues to evolve, Fabric positions itself as a valuable tool for maximizing the effectiveness of large language models and their interactions with human users.
